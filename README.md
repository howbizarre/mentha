This is a blog template powered by [**Nuxt**](https://nuxt.com "The Intuitive
Vue Framework"){:target="_blank"} framework. Currently, it uses **version 3**, but it will also support future versions. Versions lower than 3 will not be supported. The template is developed with [**Vue Composition API**](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq.html "Composition API FAQ"){:target="_blank"}, with the `setup` in the `script` tag - `<script setup lang="ts"></script>` and [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/ "Typed JavaScript"){:target="_blank"} support.

Several **Nuxt** modules are used to make the Developer Experience (**DX**) more delightful.

- [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/ "Content made easy for Vue Developers"){:target="_blank"}
- [Nuxt TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.nuxtjs.org/ "Tailwind CSS for your Nuxt Apps"){:target="_blank"}
- [Nuxt Color Mode](https://color-mode.nuxtjs.org/ "Nuxt Color Mode"){:target="_blank"}

Additionally, the **TailwindCSS** plugin [**Typography**](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography "Beautiful typographic defaults for HTML you don't control."){:target="_blank"} has been added to automate content styling.

## Required knowledge

To use the template, it is good to know how to [download it from GitHub](https://github.com/howbizarre/mentha, "Download template from GitHub repository"){:target="_blank"}.

Then it is good to know how to work with [**NPM**](https://www.npmjs.com/, "Node Package Manager"){:target="_blank"} to install the necessary packages and be able to start the project.
